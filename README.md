ThisTo-Do List Application developed using Python. The application allows users to
create, manage, and prioritize tasks efficiently. Users can log in to their accounts to keep track of their
tasks securely. The application supports features such as adding new tasks, editing or deleting
existing tasks, setting task priorities, and setting reminders.
The project also includes user authentication, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access
their personal tasks. Users can register, log in, and manage their own to-do lists. This feature
enhances data privacy, making sure each user's tasks remain secure and private. The application is
designed to be simple, user-friendly, and functional, helping users stay organized and productive.
This project showcases our understanding of Python programming, file handling, and user
authentication princip
